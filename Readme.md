# Drift and Drift Detection: A Joint Presentation

This repository contains a joint presentation focused on **drift** and **drift detection**, including their respective categories. The presentation explores:

- Types of drift (e.g., concept drift, data drift)
- Categories of drift detection methods
- Key challenges and solutions in identifying and managing drift

This collaborative effort aims to provide a clear understanding of how drift affects machine learning models and how various detection techniques can be applied to maintain model performance over time.
